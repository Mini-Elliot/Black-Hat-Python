# 🐍 Black Hat Python Tools – Upgraded to Python 3

This repository is a modernized, Python 3-compatible reimplementation of tools from the legendary book  
**Black Hat Python** by *Justin Seitz*.

> 🧠 All credit for the original ideas and tool designs belongs to the author.  
> I, **[Mini-Elliot](https://github.com/Mini-Elliot)**, have simply upgraded the code to Python 3 and made it more reliable for educational and ethical use.
